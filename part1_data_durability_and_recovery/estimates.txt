Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage


1. Minimum RTO Single AZ Outage

RDS automatically replicates the data from primary database to an instance in a different AZ. Whenever a failure is detected, RDS automatically fails over to the standby instance. RDS documentation states that the failover will happen under 35 seconds with zero data loss and with no manual intervention.
